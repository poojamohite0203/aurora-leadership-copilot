  "transcript": "Sarah Chen: Alright everyone, let's get started. Thanks for joining. The purpose of this meeting is to officially kick off the migration of our OrderProcessing monolith. Our goal is to break it down into smaller, more manageable Java microservices. Mark, you can kick us off with the why.\nMark Jefferson: Thanks, Sarah. From a product perspective, the monolith is a major bottleneck. Every time we want to release a new feature for things like payment processing or inventory management, we have to deploy the entire application. This is slow and risky. We're getting a lot of feature requests from our enterprise clients, and microservices will allow us to innovate faster and roll out changes with much less risk to the overall system.\nDavid Rodriguez: Agreed. From a development standpoint, the monolith's codebase is becoming unmanageable. The tight coupling between components makes it incredibly difficult to test and debug. We've identified a few key areas that are perfect candidates for extraction. The Payment module and the Inventory module are the most critical, as they have the clearest business boundaries.\nSarah Chen: That sounds like a great starting point. The plan is to use the Strangler Fig pattern. We'll start by extracting a single, low-risk service first to prove out the process and the new infrastructure. David, you and your team can lead the extraction of the Inventory service.\nDavid Rodriguez: Sounds good. For the tech stack, we're thinking Spring Boot for the new services, and we'll use Docker for containerization. The biggest change for our team will be moving from a shared database model to a decentralized one. We'll need to define clear APIs and data contracts between the services.\nEmily Carter: That's where I come in. For the new CI/CD pipeline, we will use GitHub Actions. We currently have a single, large GitHub Actions workflow for the monolith that builds, tests, and deploys everything at once. We'll need to break this into separate, smaller workflows, one for each new microservice.\nSarah Chen: Can you elaborate on what that new workflow will look like, Emily?\nEmily Carter: Absolutely. For each new microservice, the workflow will be much simpler. It will be triggered on a push to the main branch, run the unit tests, build a Docker image for that specific service, push it to our Azure Container Registry, and then deploy it to Azure Container Apps. We'll need to set up the Azure credentials as GitHub secrets. We also need to get logging and monitoring tools in place, like setting up a centralized logging solution.\nDavid Rodriguez: That sounds much cleaner. The current build time for the monolith is a huge pain point. Building only the specific service we changed will be a massive improvement.\nEmily Carter: Exactly. I'll also look into creating a reusable deploy workflow to standardize the deployment process across all our new microservices. This will help us maintain consistency and reduce duplication.\nSarah Chen: That's a great idea. Mark, how does this timeline align with the product roadmap?\nMark Jefferson: We have a new feature for the Q1 2026 launch that is heavily dependent on the Inventory functionality. If we can get that service extracted and running independently by then, it would be a huge win. This also gives us a great opportunity to start planning for the Payment service migration next quarter.\nSarah Chen: Okay, so here are our key action items.\nDavid: You'll create a new GitHub repository for the Inventory service and start the code extraction process.\nEmily: You'll start building the initial GitHub Actions workflow for the new Inventory service, including the Docker build and deployment to our development environment.\nMark: You'll work with me to define the API requirements for the new Inventory service and make sure the data contracts are clear.\nWe will meet again in two weeks to review the initial progress and discuss any blockers. Does that work for everyone?\nAll: Yes, that works.\nSarah Chen: Great. Thanks, everyone. Let's make this happen."
